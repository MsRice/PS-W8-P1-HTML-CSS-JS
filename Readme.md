## Overview

Project 1 - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Scenario


For this cumulative assessment on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you will select and complete one of the following Frontend Mentor  challenges:  

    [x] 2. URL Shortening API Landing Page: Create a landing page that integrates with the bitly API  to shorten URLs, featuring a list of shortened links and the ability to copy them to the clipboard.

    Important Note: Due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies causing errors with the originally suggested CleanURI  API, we have modified this project to use the bitly  API.

The code, briefs, and images for each challenge are included within this module as well, for reference. You should use the material included with this module, just in case the challenges changes in scope or

This project aims to assess your ability to apply the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course in a practical, real-world scenario. Choose the challenge that best aligns with your interests and strengths, and demonstrate your proficiency in front-end development.


## Built with

- HTML , CSS , JS
- TypeScript
- npm/npx
- API  : ([Bitly.com](https://app.bitly.com/BpbphtNIPbs/home))



## Deployment 

Deployed on Vercel:([Shortly by Rice](https://vercel.com/rice-maxwells-projects/ps-w8-p1-html-css-js/HLqAqqrKW4jPes6oS8Ksyzv4qHhu))


## Configuration and Dependancies

1. Build the TypeScript Files

    -- Compiles all .ts files into /dist:

    -- npm run build


    -- This runs: tsc --project tsconfig.json

2. Run the Compiled JavaScript

    -- After building, run the app from the dist folder:

    -- npm start

## Reflection

    Throughout the development of this project, the overall process was relatively smooth and straightforward. Most of the core functionality came together easily, especially once I had outlined the features and workflow ahead of time. The main challenge I encountered was actually unrelated to the application logic—working with Git across different devices. Switching environments introduced some minor complications with git fetch and syncing changes, but carefully reviewing branch states and ensuring the correct remote references ultimately resolved those issues.

    Implementing the Bitly API turned out to be one of the more satisfying parts of the project. After reading through the documentation, the integration went smoothly, and the endpoints responded exactly as expected. This reinforced the value of taking the time to understand an external tool before jumping into code.

    I also found myself really enjoying the styling approach I used here. The visual direction felt consistent, simple, and clean, and it inspired me to revisit and potentially refresh the UI of some older projects. Thoughtful styling added a lot of polish to the final result with only a modest time investment.

    Looking ahead, there are a few meaningful improvements I’d like to make. One key enhancement is replacing the current alert-based error notifications with inline, in-page error messaging. This would provide a smoother user experience and help errors feel like part of the interface rather than interruptions. I’m also considering expanding the UI further to make the tool more responsive and visually dynamic.

    Overall, this project reinforced good development habits while giving me room to refine both technical and design skills.
